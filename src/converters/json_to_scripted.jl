# According to file format specified in Matlab script
# written by Mykel Kochenderfer, mykel@stanford.edu
#
# This script converts a json file produced by RLES and converts it to a "scripts" file
# of the following format:
#
#   SCRIPTS FILE:
#   The scripts file contains a set of scripted encounters. Each
#   encounter is defined by a set of encounter scripts associated with a
#   fixed number of aircraft. The file is organized as follows:
#
#   [Header]
#   uint32 (number of encounters)
#   uint32 (number of aircraft)
#       [Encounter 1]
#           [Initial]
#               [Aircraft 1]
#               double (initial airspeed in ft/s)
#               double (initial north position in ft)
#               double (initial east position in ft)
#               double (initial altitude in ft)
#               double (initial heading angle in radians)
#               double (initial flight path angle in radians)
#               double (initial roll angle in radians)
#               double (initial airspeed acceleration in ft/s^2)
#               ...
#               [Aircraft n]
#               double (initial airspeed in ft/s)
#               double (initial north position in ft)
#               double (initial east position in ft)
#               double (initial altitude in ft)
#               double (initial heading angle in radians)
#               double (initial flight path angle in radians)
#               double (initial roll angle in radians)
#               double (initial airspeed acceleration in ft/s^2)
#           [Updates]
#               [Aircraft 1]
#               uint8 (number of updates)
#                   [Update 1]
#                   double (time in s)
#                   double (commanded vertical rate in ft/s)
#                   double (commanded turn rate in rad/s)
#                   double (commanded airspeed acceleration in ft/s^2)
#                   ...
#                   [Update m]
#                   double (time in s)
#                   double (commanded vertical rate in ft/s)
#                   double (commanded turn rate in rad/s)
#                   double (commanded airspeed acceleration in ft/s^2)
#               ...
#               [Aircraft n]
#                   ...
#       ...
